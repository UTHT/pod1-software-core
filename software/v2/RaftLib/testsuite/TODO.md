###Notes

The following test cases build and work on OS X Yosemite and Linux using 
Intel ICC and GNU GCC 4.9 and Apple Clang (fixed the dependant template 
problem, looks prettier without the proper syntax, but well...compiles
more easily on clang with the correct syntax):

* allocate\_s
* dynallocate
* foreach
* gamma
* gaussian
* iterator
* partitionTest
* sequential
* portTypeException
* peekrange
* lambdatest 
* split
* stdlibsupport
